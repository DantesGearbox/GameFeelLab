There are wierd bugs in the raycast collision. Consider fixing.
Make sword swings.
Make objects that scatter in random direction and then return to a set transform after a time.
Make screen-shake.
Make object-shake for health/EXP bars.
Make ghost-jumping.
Make the RaycastCollisionChecks class have OnEnter and OnExit collision for all 4 directions
Make a dash ability.
Implement platforms like in Sebs tutorial.
Implement color switching like in Sebs platform tutorial.

////// THINGS THAT ANNOY ME ABOUT THIS FRAMEWORK ///////
My grvaity is fucked. Unity gravity allows for easy moving platforms. Just use that.
Collisions need an OnCollisionEnter type field/function for all 4 direction, not just whether we are colliding or not
Input needs an OnButtonPressed type field/function for all buttons (maybe even axes), not just whether we are pressing the button or not
